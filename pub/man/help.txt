How to Run
-----------
Run jeddy in the work folder by running the "jeddy" command in the terminal:

    jeddy

Now you can open the browser at:

    localhost:9101

It will show the work folder file manifest by default.

Click on a file hyperlink to edit.


You can open a file directly by providing it's relative path in the URL string, e.g.:


    localhost:9101/#.data.txt

Opens work-folder/data.txt.

----------------
How to Configure
----------------
Jeddy creates a .jeddy file in the working directory with configuration JSON.
Just edit and save that JSON as a regular text file.
